## Key Features

### Tools at your disposal
NGVO (Next Generation Visual Overhaul) is a comprehensive visual baseline list designed around the philosophy as making it as moddable as possible while offering the absolute best visuals you can find. As such, the plugin count is under 300 with less than 40 ESP/ESM's, giving you over 210 ESP/ESM slots to work with.

### Graphical Changes
The primary focus of NGVO is the visuals. Although some things are subject to change, NGVO attempts to introduce a more vibrant ï»¿Skyrim atmosphere with mods such as Fantasia Landscapes, Traverse the Ulvenwald, Cabbage ENB and Vinland Grass Patch.

### Modular
NGVO is separated in a way to make it easy to use and understand. For example, Northern Roads is included by default but you can simple remove it as well as all of its patches (located in the same separator), rerun LODs and you have yourself Blended Roads instead.

### Engine Enhancement
Stability, Balance, Bug Fixes, & Performance Improvements. As with any modern modlist, NGVO comes with all of the latest bugfixes and improvements where possible. The list was designed with STABILITY and optimization in mind.
