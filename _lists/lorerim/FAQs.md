## How much space?
- ~300GB install, ~250GB download, ~550GB total.
- **MAKE SURE TO SETUP A 40GB PAGE FILE**. [How to Manage Virtual Memory (Pagefile) in Windows 10](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html)

## Why is it giving me install errors?
- Make sure you download all Anniversary Edition (paid upgrade) content and launch Skyrim SE in Steam once to install.
- Also, make sure to download Skyrim SE Creation Kit and launch it at least once.

## How to change Resolution?
- The best way is through the `SSEDisplayTweaks.ini` file, which is located in the "LoreRim - MCM and INI Settings" mod.
- Note: This file is in the **MOD** in MO2, and **NOT IN-GAME**.

## System Requirements?
- Not sure, but probably at least:
  - 2070 for 1080p
  - 3080 for 1440p
  - 4080 for 4k to run smoothly

## I crash on launch?
- You didn't disable DLAA, and you don't have an RTX GPU.
- Disable DLAA and either enable ENB AA or TAA.
- Enable ENB AA by pressing `Shift + Enter` in-game and navigating to "Anti Aliasing" in the top left.

## I crash with Wheeler.
- Wheeler can cause crashes in circumstances such as using self-made potions/poisons. I would avoid these.
- You can also press `Home` and navigate to Wheeler and "reset wheels" if this happens.

## I crash on load after death?
- That's why the death alternative mod exists â€” to disincentivize reloading.
- If you have to reload, wait about 60 seconds outside of combat or traveling before attempting to.
- This is a script-heavy modlist. Reloading in combat or during events can cause issues.
- I also **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** at least going to the main menu before reloading your save on any list. The **IDEAL** way is to exit out completely to the desktop and reload.

## I crash after loading a cell?
- Please check if it is repeatable. Lux can sometimes cause freak random crashes, but it's impossible to diagnose if it isn't repeatable.
- This just has to do with how the lighting, shadows, and meshes interact with each other.
- Still, Lux is by far the best currently available lighting mod, so it stays.

## I'm walking slow?
- You're out of stamina. Requiem feature.
- Make sure to manage your stamina. Invest perks in armor, otherwise, it will drain over time. Eat food. Grab the Lady Stone.

## My FPS is so bad?
- Enable the performance profile.
- Run VRAMR; no official support if you run VRAMR though, do it at your own discretion. (From WhisperDealer)
- Also recommend Lossless Scaling.

## Widescreen support?
- Yes, look at the optional section towards the top of MO2.

## Controller support?
- Yes, unofficial for now, but follow [this guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111887) and enable the controller optionals in MO2.

## My followers have no carry weight?
- They have similar restrictions to the player. No free pack mules.

## How do I use quicklight?
- You need to craft a "lantern with fuel".
- To do this, craft/buy lantern fuel and click on an empty lantern in your inventory. It should turn into a "Lantern with Fuel".

## How do I make potions?
- You need empty bottles. You can find them, buy them, or get them back from using potions.

## How to change dual block or parry key?
- It's in the Dual Parry INI settings. [DXScanCodes](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script#DXScanCodes)

## How to prevent followers from dying?
- In Requiem MCM settings, turn off Requiem's essential/protected handling system.

## How to change FOV?
- `Shift + Home` to open Improved Camera settings.

## I crash on my potato?
- At the end of the day, LoreRim has mid-spec requirements for the normal profile and high-end for Ultra.
- If you don't meet these, I can't do much for you unfortunately.
- You **ABSOLUTELY** must meet the minimum requirements and install the list on a **SOLID STATE DRIVE**.

Note: As a low spec user myself, I would recommend Wildlander as an alternate Requiem list for lower specs.
