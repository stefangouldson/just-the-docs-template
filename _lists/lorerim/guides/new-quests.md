# Lorerim Quest Mods Overview

Lorerim comes with several new quest mods, from expansions of vanilla quests to DLC-sized mods that expand upon the game. This guide will help indicate how to start them.

## Beyond Skyrim: Bruma

*Beyond Skyrim: Bruma* is a DLC-sized quest mod that adds a portion of Cyrodiil as a playable worldspace, comparable in size to the Dragonborn DLC. There are two main ways to access Bruma in Lorerim 2.0:

- Use the alternate start option to begin in Cyrodiil.
- Travel directly to the border gate located south of Helgen. From there, you can either negotiate your way through the gate or use a nearby cave system.

More detailed information on the cave location and a full walkthrough of the quests can be found on the [UESP Wiki](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Beyond_Skyrim:Cyrodiil/Welcome_to_Cyrodiil) and the [Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917/?tab=description).

## Sirenroot - Deluge of Deceit

*Sirenroot* is a large quest mod based heavily on puzzles and water mechanics inside an Ayleid ruin underneath Lake Honrich near Riften. To begin this quest, speak to Frissa Black-Briar at Elgrim's Elixirs in Riften to join the expedition team. Beware, your choices in this quest will greatly affect the outcome! A detailed walkthrough guide is available on the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70917) if you get stuck.

## Heart of the Reach

*Heart of the Reach* is a quest mod that takes place in an underground swamp where you will either help or harm a priest attempting to heal the Heart of the Reach. This quest mod has multiple different outcomes and endings based on the choices you make. To start, speak to Gwilym, a new NPC located at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth. More details, including a walkthrough, are included on the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76494).

## Meridia's Order

"A new hand touches the beacon...", but different this time. *Meridia's Order* is a large quest mod that adds a new faction and questline with its own locations, followers, bosses, and loot, unlocked after completing the "The Break of Dawn" quest. After completion, you will later be greeted in any major city by one of Meridia's Order's Paladins. This questline is choice-based and has many different paths to completion. Beware, because Lorerim is based around Requiem, the undead are no joke. Recommended level to begin is 25+. [More info here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102584).

## The Tools of Kagrenac

*The Tools of Kagrenac* is a quest mod centered around the legendary trio of artifacts—Keening, Sunder, and Wraithguard—created by Lord Kagrenac to use the Heart of Lorkhan. Keening is already available in Skyrim through the College of Winterhold side quests for Arniel Gane. This mod ties into that, starting after you obtain Keening from Arniel Gane's quests and complete the "Way of the Voice" main quest. After a few in-game days, you will receive a letter from a courier, starting this questline. Details, including puzzle hints, are included on the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14168).

## Project AHO

*Project AHO* is a DLC-sized quest mod based around a hidden Dunmer settlement of Great House Telvanni, built over the ruins of a once-great Dwarven city. This expansion includes its own quest line, locations, characters, music, armor, weapons, and spells. To begin this questline, you must be level 15+ and travel to Mixwater Mill located south of Windhelm, where you will be contacted. For more information, including walkthroughs of all quests, please visit the [mod's wiki](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Project_AHO) or the [Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996).

## Clockwork

*Clockwork* is a quest and player home mod centered around a castle high in the mountains that has been long forgotten. This quest has no starting requirements other than being level 5 and will begin randomly when traveling around Skyrim's wilderness. For those who want to know, the quest will point you towards the "Velothi mountain tunnels" in the far eastern portion of the map. More details on the contents of the castle and the quests themselves are available on the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155). Be warned: this quest has a point of no return early on, meaning you will not be able to return to Skyrim until the quest is completed. This point is very noticeable, so you won't miss it.

## Other Quests

There are many other quest mods that have been added. It's worth mentioning that *Saints & Seducers Extended Cut* is another new quest mod detailed in our Quest Guide. Some other quests include:

- **Legends of Aetherium**: To start, travel to any of the following inns around Skyrim and find a hiring notice, which will start the quest.
- **Fists of Fury**: To start, you need to win a number of vanilla brawls. After a day, you will receive a letter.
- **Siege at Icemoth**: To start, travel west from Northwatch Keep and find the dead mercenary. Read the waterlogged journal and use the boat at Old Wooden Jetty. This is at the northwestern beach in Skyrim.
- **Belethor's Sister**: To begin, talk to Belethor when you are level 20.
- **Skyrim Sewers**: Not really a quest mod, but it adds sewers to Skyrim that can be explored. These often lead to old ruins that hold powerful items.

Additionally, two mod authors are adding small quest mods that greatly enhance Skyrim:
- **Nimwraith**: [Profile link](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/nimwraith/mods?gameId=1704).
- **TheOscar0** (also the author of *Meridia's Order*): [Profile link](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/TheOscar0/mods?gameId=1704).
