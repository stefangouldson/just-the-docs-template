# Lorerim Quest Overhauls

Lorerim overhauls several quests from the base game, DLCs, and Creation Club. This guide will help indicate how to start them.

## Major Quests

There are 3 major questlines in Skyrim Special Edition: the main quest, the Dawnguard DLC, and the Dragonborn DLC. These have been slightly altered with the "At Your Own Pace" mod, which adds breaks in the questlines. These breaks either delay when the quest can be started or add other requirements to progress. For more information, check out the [mod description here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704).

### Main Quest

There are some alternate routes available in the main quest now:
- **Storm the Thalmor Embassy** allows you to skip the "party" and go straight to the Thalmor Embassy during "Diplomatic Immunity".
- **Defeat the Dragon Cult** expands the later half of the main quest, giving the Dragonborn a reason to avoid facing Alduin until all the Dragon Priests are dead.
- **Paarthurnax - Quest Expansion** provides an option where you no longer need to kill Paarthurnax. [Read more about it here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80974).

### Dawnguard

The Dawnguard questline has been delayed thanks to **Sensible Quest Prerequisites**. With this mod, the quest "Laid to Rest" is now a prerequisite for starting Dawnguard. If you've never done this quest before, itâ€™s a side quest in Morthal revolving around figuring out the story behind a burned-down house.

Additionally, curing vampirism has been expanded for both the Dragonborn and Serana:
- **Seeking The Cure** repurposes "Rising At Dawn" into a non-repeatable, story-focused quest where Falion's ritual to cure your vampirism fails.
- **Serana Cure Quest Plus** adds more to Serana's cure quest.

### Dragonborn

The Dragonborn DLC has a few changes, the biggest being **Defy the Gardener**, which provides another way to learn the final Word of Power of the Bend Will Shout. Storn lives, and you can also claim a new Black Book for your own! [Read more on the mod description page here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58079).

## Factions

Factions have also been expanded with **At Your Own Pace**. These expansions add more radiant quests to progress (Companions & Thieves Guild) or allow you to complete their main questlines without officially joining for role-playing purposes (Companions & College of Winterhold). The mod also allows the player to be more of a good guy in the Thieves Guild. [Mod description here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95958).

- **College of Winterhold - Quest Expansion by JaySerpa**: This mod gives the player lessons when they join the college. These lessons provide spell tomes to learn from and then a quest in which to use them. [Read more here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66666).

- **The Dark Brotherhood** has additional contracts, but the biggest changes are in the first quest ("Innocence Lost") and **Destroy the Dark Brotherhood**:
  - "Innocence Lost" has been expanded by JaySerpa, allowing for a more lawful approach. [Mod link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80974).
  - The destroy route has also been expanded with **Unfaltered Virtue**. [Link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117478).

- **The Bards College** now has more to do with **The Shadow Song**. [Read the mod description here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73537).

## Daedric Quests

Each Daedric Prince's quest has been expanded to provide actual player choice, not just the illusion of it. 

- **MadAborModding** has made several quest mods expanding Daedric quests. [Check out their profile here](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MadAborModding/mods).

  - **Boethiah's Calling**: Can now start at the Inn in Kynsegrove.
  - **The Taste of Death** (Namira): Players can reject Eola in the Markarth Hall of the Dead.
  - **Mephala's Curse**: Addon to "The Whispering Door."
  - **Mehrunes Dagon's Shrine**: Unlocked.

- **JaySerpa** has also made quest expansions for Daedric quests, including:
  - **The Whispering Door** (Mephala)
  - **The Only Cure** (Peryite)
  - **House of Horrors** (Molag Bal)

At the time of writing, JaySerpa is arguably the best modder for Skyrim on Nexus. In his series of mods, he has expanded several side quests, providing more content and alternate routes/endings. [Check out his profile here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51711).

## Creation Club

Lorerim requires the Anniversary Edition upgrade, which includes all Creation Club content. These have also been expanded in Lorerim:

- **Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers** is a huge DLC-sized expansion to the Saints & Seducers content included in the AE update. To begin the mod questline, you must be at least level 20 and have completed "The Mind of Madness". This quest mod also affects the following Creation Club content: Shadowrend, Ruin's Edge, and the Staff of Sheogorath.

- Some content was removed to be more lore-friendly. [Link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111995).

- Some Creation Club homes now have additional requirements to unlock them through this mod. [Link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116032).

- "Here, it's all in this note": These quests have been expanded with the **Voiced Narrative series by GTheGenerous**. [Profile link here](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/GTheGenerous/mods?gameId=1704).

- JaySerpa also expanded on **The Gift of Saturalia** and **Simple Fishing Overhaul**. Click the link shared above to find these mods and read more.

Other Creation Club quests that have been expanded or changed for both balance and fun include:
- **Morihaus' Refuge**: [Link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68558).
- **Knight of the North**: [Link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45869).
- **The Cause Tweaks**: [Link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112918).

Items added by Creation Club, like weapons and armor, have been distributed in an immersive and balanced way.

There are many other quests in Skyrim that have been expanded in Lorerim, such as **The Golden Claw**, **The Icerunner**, and many more. But I'll let you discover these yourself.
